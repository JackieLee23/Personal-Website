        <h2>Hello</h2>

          <h3>Programming</h3>
          <p class = "codeskill">I am able to code proficiently in Java and C++. Well, maybe not proficiently. But I can write loops and stuff. Also if statements. Also
          more stuff, like lists and arrays and stuff. I'm realizing this sounds like I don't know what I'm doing, but I assure you I do! Totally. Completely. Indubitably</p>

          <h3>Learning</h3>
          <p class = "learnskill">I can absorb and apply new information quickly. I have gone to school for many years. I can write words. Words I can write. Writing is a capability I have learned from learning.
          Learning is a skill, which, like many skills, can be learned. Have I mentioned that I can learn?</p>
